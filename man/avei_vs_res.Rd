\title{Mean and standard deviation in resolution shells.}
\usage{
avei_vs_res(nbin, resos, II = NULL, m = max(resos), M = min(resos))
}
\arguments{
\item{nbin}{A positive integer. The number of resolution shells.}

\item{resos}{A vector of real quantities. These are the resolutions (in angstroms)
corresponding to the data vector, II. If the data vector is missing, the averages
will be computed just for resos.}

\item{II}{A vector of real quantities. This is the key quantity whose averages
and standard deviations are calculated. If \code{II} is set to \code{NULL}, resolutions
averages and standard deviations will be the calculated quantities.}

\item{m}{Minimum (highest) resolution (in angstroms). Data with resolution smaller than m
will be ignored when calculating the averages.}

\item{M}{Maximum (lowest) resolution (in angstroms). Data with resolution larger than M
will be ignored when calculating the averages.}
}
\value{
A named list of length 4. \code{counts} is a vector of integers, the number of
 reflections in each resolution shell. \code{mids} is the representative inverse resolution
 for each resolution shell; the value is decided by the function \code{hist}. \code{ave}
 is the average value in each resolution shell and \code{sd} is the corresponding standard
 deviation.
}
\description{
Calculates averages and standard deviations of the input vector quantity for all
reflections, corresponding to shells of resolution.
}
\details{
Binning is done with inverse resolutions in order to have lower resolutions
 correspond to small numbers and high resolutions to large numbers. The output
 \code{mids}, \code{ave} and \code{sd} correspond to inverse resolutions.
